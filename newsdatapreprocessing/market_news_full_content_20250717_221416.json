        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information. Week ahead Monday, June 16 Empire State Manufacturing Index at 8:30 a.m. ET After the close: Lennar Corp (LEN) Tuesday, June 17 Census Bureau's retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Import and Export Price Indexes at 8:30 a.m. ET Capital Utilization and Industrial Production Data at 9:15 a.m. ET Before the bell: Jabil (JBL) After the close: Beyond Air (XAIR), La-Z-Boy (LZB) Wednesday, June 18 Initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET Housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET Federal Reserve policy meeting meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET Before the bell: GMS Inc.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

        "full_content": "Over the course of three meetings, the Fed lowered rates by a full percentage point to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, which was maintained Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to pause at its first meeting of 2025 followed a series of cuts that began in September to account for progress already made on getting inflation down.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, as the central bank turned cautious on further cuts amid a sturdy economy and uncertainty about inflation.\n\nIn a statement released alongside the decision, the Fed described the labor market as “solid,” noting that the unemployment rate had “stabilized at a low level.”\n\nInflation concerns continued to dominate, however, with the Fed scrapping earlier guidance about the progress made in achieving the central bank’s 2 percent inflation goal. Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "full_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the US stock market “kind of inflated” — even as he urged critics to “get over” their fears of President Trump’s proposed tariffs.\n\nDuring an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon cautioned investors on the risks of increased deficit spending, sticky inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Asset prices are kind of inflated, by any measure. They are in the top 10% or 15%” of historical valuations, Dimon said.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO issued caution on the US stock market, calling it “kind of inflated.” REUTERS\n\nThe 68-year-old chief executive said he was speaking specifically about the US stock market – which has seen record gains during a multi-year bull run.\n\nThe S&P 500 had annual gains of more than 20% both last year and in 2023 – the first time the US stock market has seen back-to-back gains of that size in 25 years. Last year, Dimon even said JPMorgan’s shares were too expensive.\n\nDimon also pointed out that parts of the bond market, like the country’s sovereign debt, are “at all-time highs.”\n\n“So yeah, they’re elevated, and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices,” Dimon said at the conference. “Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there, and they can tend to surprise you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon chastised critics of Trump’s hefty proposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, telling them to “get over it.”\n\nTariffs can be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon,” depending on how they’re used, Dimon said.\n\n“I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” he added. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose sizable tariffs – including a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, to take effect Feb. 1.\n\n4 President Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to impose hefty tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."

        "full_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact — in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"\n\nPowell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThe president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.\n\nAlthough Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.\n\nThe Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for overnight loans — steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.\n\n\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.\n\n\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\""

        "full_content": "Wall Street is heading into a holiday-shortened week of trading — but there's unlikely to be a shortage of news for investors to process thanks to heightened geopolitical tensions and a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting. Here are the four big things we're watching in the week ahead. 1. Geopolitics. The fallout of the Israel-Iran attacks figure to shape global financial markets in the coming days and potentially much longer depending on where the tense situation goes from here. The developing conflict underscores that geopolitics are firmly on our radar, beyond just trade talks. Stocks fell and oil prices surged Friday on the first round of strikes. Over the weekend the attacks escalated, with Israel's military targeting key oil infrastructure in Iran — a potentially market-moving development. On the trade front, we're keeping a close eye on whether we get any meaningful updates on U.S. agreements with other countries. The expiration of President Donald Trump's 90-day \"reciprocal\" tariff pause is set for July 9, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that extensions could be given for countries that are negotiating with the U.S. in \"good faith.\" So, perhaps we learn of some extensions being dolled out. 2. Fed meeting. The Fed's two-day policy meeting is the biggest economic event of the week. Despite Trump's pressure for interest rate cuts, the market widely expects the U.S. central bank to leave rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%. As usual, Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET will be influential, as investors try to understand how the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability during the trade war. The labor market has been resilient, but there's also been clear signs of softening, with recurring jobless claims being at their highest levels since November 2021. Recent inflation data has come in cooler than expected, supporting the case for rate cuts. However, many argue the full effects of elevated tariffs haven't shown up in the data yet. \"If it weren't for these prospective tariffs that will flow through — and are flowing through — I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates now,\" Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president, said Friday on CNBC. And while it's too early to know whether the Middle East tensions will lead to a sustained increase in the price of oil, it represents another wrinkle to the economic picture. U.S. oil prices falling into the low-to-mid $60s a barrel this year had contributed to inflation declines and gave consumers more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere. Kaplan said the Fed will watch the Israel-Iran situation \"carefully\" to determine what impact, if any, it will have on the global economy. \"They'll watch it like the rest of us. They'll watch it to day to day,\" he said. This meeting is one of the four each year when the Fed provides individual members' expectations for rate cuts in what's known as the \"dot plot.\" The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections also will contain a refreshed outlook for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. 3. Economic data. While the week ahead lacks a major inflation or monthly payroll report, there are still some noteworthy releases that can inform our understanding of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, we get the Census Bureau's retail sales report for the month of May. In the April report we saw less stockpiling to beat tariffs than in March. The question for May is how resilient consumer spending proved to be. The CEO of Club name Capital One , Richard Fairbank, said at an industry conference Tuesday that its internal card data hasn't shown a major effect from tariffs. \"Despite all the noise out there and the tariff news and everything, even when we look at the very latest daily data on things like spending data or anything related to consumer behavior, we just don't see an effect,\" he said. Also on Tuesday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly look at U.S. import and export prices — a report that historically hasn't gotten a ton of attention, but now provides another way to measure the impact of tariffs. Before we hear from the Fed on Wednesday, new housing starts and initial jobless claims are both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. (With the market closed Thursday for Juneteenth, jobless claims are out a day earlier than normal.) We're interested in the housing starts data because more activity in that sector benefits Club name Home Depot , and more homes being built in the U.S. should help on the inflation front . Shelter inflation remains sticky. Plus, as Jim Cramer likes to say, housing punches above its weight in the economy because people moving into homes end up buying a lot more than just the structure itself. As discussed above, the jobless claims data will be important due to its implications for Fed policy and what it says about the U.S. economy overall. Both first-time filings and continuing claims are relevant in this moment. 4. Earnings. No Club names are set to report in the coming days, but we will be watching what the homebuilder Lennar has to say on Monday night, followed by Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Friday. Lennar is notable for the same reasons we care about the housing starts data. As for Darden, its results and commentary on consumer spending trends can provide a read-through to Club holding Texas Roadhouse . It's no secret that we're big fans of earnings reports around here because they allow us to hear real-time updates from management teams on conference calls. Sure, the results are backward-looking, but their forecasts and commentary factor in the latest information. In such a dynamic environment, where tariff rates are fluid and tensions are flaring, earnings reports arguably become even more valuable for investors. By contrast, the factors that influenced an official government report on the economy might be way different than when we receive that information.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic Sunday in a Princeton University speech in which he also praised government employees and U.S. universities, both of which have been targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nPowell and the central bank have been subject to extensive criticism in recent weeks by President Donald Trump and a potential successor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.\n\nSpeaking at a baccalaureate service ahead of Tuesday’s commencement, Powell, who noted he graduated from Princeton 50 years ago, specifically defended the central bank’s decision to cut its key interest rate to nearly zero in response to the pandemic. It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n“With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,” Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.”\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump’s attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” Powell said. “Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed’s governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed’s pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that. Their collective efforts saved our economy, and the career civil servants involved deserve our respect and gratitude; it is my great honor to serve alongside them.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Powell spoke at a baccalaureate service at Princeton, not the commencement, which is planned for Tuesday."

        "full_content": "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"\n\nThe latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell is an option.\n\nInterest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.\n\nMr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.\n\nThe White House declined further comment.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.\n\nCan Mr. Trump fire Powell?\n\nBoard members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.\n\n\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.\n\nWhile lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.\n\nWho appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?\n\nPowell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.\n\nWhat is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?\n\nMr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nHe added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"\n\nInflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate.\n\nWhat has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?\n\nPowell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"\n\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.\n\nStill, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.\n\nWhat do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?\n\nWall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.\n\nThe market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.\n\n\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"\n\nThe Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.\n\nWhat has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.\n\nSome lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"\n\n\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.\n\n\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"\n\nWilliam English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"\n\n\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.\n\ncontributed to this report."

Rather, it said that inflation remained “somewhat elevated.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAngst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again.\n\nIn December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Trump for some officials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.\n\nKey to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.\n\nTrump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to US importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with US firms, which would further insulate consumers.\n\nTrump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the United States than China’s President Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times event in December, Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

AP\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that the tariffs could stoke inflation once more, especially combined with mass deportations.\n\nBut Dimon signaled more faith in Trump’s plan, arguing that tariffs can be used as a negotiating tool to “bring people to the table.” He said he believes the Trump administration is using the threats this way.\n\nIt’s not the first time Dimon has backed Trump, saying soon after the president’s election win that Wall Street bankers were “dancing in the street” on hopes that Trump would loosen industry regulations.\n\n4 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told critics of Trump’s proposed tariffs to “get over it.” Christopher Sadowski\n\nIf the threats are simply a bartering tool, as Dimon suggested, then the US might levy lighter tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, or no new tariffs at all.\n\n“We’re going to find out,” Dimon said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on goods like solar panels and washing machines, and materials like steel and aluminum. He also increased tariffs on goods from China.\n\nDespite Dimon’s more upbeat take on the proposed tariffs, he has long been reluctant to claim victory over inflation.\n\nIn 2022, the chief executive – who grew JPMorgan Chase into the largest American bank by both assets and market valuation – warned that a “hurricane” was headed for the US economy.\n\n4 Jamie Dimon said Trump’s proposed tariffs could be a negotiating tool. REUTERS\n\n“I do have a little more caution around a bunch of subjects,” Dimon said during the World Economic Forum. “What I’m a little cautious about is the deficit spending; it’s a global issue, not just an American issue.”\n\nHe also stood by his previous statements on inflation, predicting it might be here to stay.\n\n“‘Will inflation go away?’ I’m not so sure,” Dimon said.\n\nHe said global concerns, like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East and threats from China have “just got me very concerned how it’s going to affect our world for the next 100 years.”"

        "full_content": "Inflation is likely to continue to ease and possibly allow the central bank to cut interest rates sooner and faster than expected, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday in comments that pushed against recent market moves that anticipate a shallower Fed rate path.\n\nInflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Waller said on CNBC, citing estimates indicating that one key measure of underlying inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy costs, has been close to the Fed’s target for six of the past eight months.\n\nThe next monthly PCE report will not be released until Jan. 31, two days after the end of the Fed’s upcoming policy meeting, but analysts expect the monthly increase in core inflation may translate to an annual rate of less than 2%.\n\n3 Inflation “is getting close to what our 2% inflation target would be,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said. REUTERS\n\n“If we continue getting numbers like this, it is reasonable to think rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year … I am optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we will get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking,” Waller said, adding that as many as three or four quarter-percentage-point rate reductions could still be possible this year depending on how inflation behaves.\n\n“If inflation is down and the labor market stays solid, you could think about restarting rate cuts several months from now … I don’t think March could be completely ruled out,” Waller said, referring to the Fed’s March 18-19 policy meeting. “If we make a lot of progress, you could do more.”\n\nWaller’s somewhat dovish narrative, coming near the Fed’s blackout period on public comments ahead of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, immediately shifted market expectations about where the central bank stands at the start of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to hold its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range at its meeting later this month, but investors had expected the pause to last until perhaps June, with only a single rate cut this year.\n\nAfter Waller’s remarks investors shifted toward a view of two rate cuts as more likely, with a good chance the first comes as early as May. Bond yields also fell.\n\n3 Some analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible. Getty Images\n\n‘Still restrictive’\n\nThe Fed is trying to reconcile relatively strong economic data with the need for inflation to fall somewhat further.\n\nSome analysts have looked at things like strong retail sales and a relatively low unemployment rate to argue Fed policy is not restricting the economy as much as thought, with a new surge of inflation possible.\n\nBut “you are not seeing a labor market that is starting to overheat or accelerate … Things are still restrictive,” Waller said.\n\n3 Waller hasn’t ruled out March for rate cuts. Christopher Sadowski\n\nThe Fed is also trying to assess how President-elect Donald Trump’s policies may influence the performance of the economy in coming months. Trump will begin his second term in the White House on Monday.\n\nWaller anticipates any influence on prices from increased tariffs on imports, for example, would be fleeting.\n\n“I don’t think tariffs would have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,” Waller said."

        "full_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Thursday following a mixed set of earnings reports from Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group and other big companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between small gains and losses through the day. More stocks rose within the index than fell, but drops for some influential stocks like Tesla outweighed them.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%.\n\nThe relatively modest moves for stocks came a day after they shot higher on hopes that an encouraging report on inflation may convince the Federal Reserve to deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. Treasury yields were also more placid in the bond market following mixed economic reports on Thursday.\n\nOne report showed growth for sales at U.S. retailers wasn’t as strong last month as economists expected. Another said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and a third said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area unexpectedly roared back to growth.\n\nAP AUDIO: Stock market today: Wall Street’s momentum slows as US stocks drift The AP’s Seth Sutel reports stocks lose momentum after big gains yesterday.\n\nTaken together, the trio of reports suggests the U.S. economy is nowhere near a recession but may be showing some signs of slowing that could keep pressure off inflation. Markets have been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports force traders to revamp their expectations about what the Federal Reserve may do with interest rates in 2025.\n\nWhen reports have calmed worries about inflation, expectations have climbed for possible cuts to rates. That has typically sent Treasury yields lower and stock prices higher. When inflation looks to be a bigger problem, whether through a still-solid economy or possible policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump, Treasury yields have climbed, and stock prices have tended to sink.\n\nOn Thursday, yields eased modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.61% from 4.66% late Wednesday and from 4.79% on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which more closely follows expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, slipped to 4.23% from 4.27% late Wednesday and from 4.37% two days ago.\n\nTreasury yields are still higher than they were last autumn, though. And higher yields can put downward pressure on stock prices, unless companies deliver higher profits to make up for it.\n\nOn Wall Street, Morgan Stanley climbed 4% after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Ted Pick said investment banking improved in the quarter. Strong financial markets also helped its total client assets grow to $7.9 trillion across its wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nIt followed stronger-than-expected profit reports from a bevy of banks the day before, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America also delivered a profit report on Thursday that beat expectations, but its stock was more subdued. It fell 1%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp, meanwhile, fell to one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after reporting results for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It dropped 5.6%.\n\nThe only stock to lose more in the index was UnitedHealth Group, which tumbled 6%. The insurer reported a stronger profit than expected, but its revenue for the latest quarter came up shy of forecasts. A rise in medical costs surprised analysts.\n\nIt was the company’s first financial report since the shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel early last month.\n\nAnother weight on the market was Tesla, which fell 3.4% on news it is offering discounts on its Cybertruck, the latest sign that Elon Musk’s company is struggling to attract buyers as sales of its electric vehicle models drop for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.57 points to 5,937.34. The Dow dipped 68.42 to 43,153.13, and the Nasdaq composite sank 172.94 to 19,338.29.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.1%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.2% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2% for some of the bigger gains.\n\nTaiwan computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter jumped 57%. The world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer — which has found itself in the middle of a trade and technology rift between the U.S. and China — said it results were propelled by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIts stock that trades in the United States rose 3.9%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Bernard Condon contributed."
